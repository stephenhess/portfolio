In the 3+ years I was at the company, we designed and built three successful consumer business lines which are home to millions of users, hundreds of thousands of which pay for membership. You can view some of the primary features below and <a href="/projects/reputation/reputation-prototype/" target="_blank">click here to check out the design prototype</a> used in user research and to guide development</h1>
